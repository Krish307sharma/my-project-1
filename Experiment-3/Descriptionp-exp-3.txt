Admin Dashboard – Detailed Description
This project is a simple Admin Dashboard created using HTML for the structure and CSS for styling. It’s divided into two files:

index.html → Contains the layout and content.

exp-3.css → Contains all the styling rules.

HTML (index.html)
The HTML layout is made to be clean and easy to understand. Everything is inside a main <div> with the class container. This container holds three main sections: Header, Main, and Footer.

Header
At the top, there’s a header bar with the text “Admin Dashboard” on the left and “Dark Mode” on the right.
The header is designed so both items are spaced apart and aligned in the center vertically.

Main Section
This is split into two parts using CSS Grid:

Navigation (Left side) → A simple sidebar with links: Home, Users, and Settings. These are inside an unordered list.

Content Area (Right side) → Shows a welcome message (“Welcome, Admin!”) and a short paragraph. This is where the actual dashboard content like charts, tables, or reports can be added later.

Footer
At the bottom, there’s a footer with the text “© 2025 Admin Panel”.
It runs across the whole width of the container.

CSS (exp-3.css)
The CSS gives the dashboard its look and layout.

Basic Styling
I removed the default page margin and set a clean font. The main container is centered on the page, has a border, and takes up 90% of the screen height.

Header
The header has a green background, white text, and uses Flexbox to space the title and “Dark Mode” text evenly.

Main Section
The main part is a two-column grid:

The first column (200px wide) is the sidebar.

The second column fills the rest of the space for the main content.

Sidebar (nav)
The sidebar has a light gray background. The links are blue, without underlines, and spaced nicely.

Content Area (section)
The content area has padding so text doesn’t touch the edges.

Footer
The footer has the same green background as the header, white centered text, and smaller font size.
