Freehand SVG Drawing Tool – Detailed Description

This project is a Freehand SVG Drawing Tool that allows the user to draw freehand lines directly on an SVG canvas using the mouse. It also includes a Clear button to reset the canvas. The project is divided into three parts:

1.exp6.html → Structure of the page

2.exp6.css → Styling and design

3.exp6.js → Drawing functionality

HTML (exp6.html)

1.The HTML file provides the basic structure of the drawing tool.

2.A toolbar containing a "Clear" button for removing all drawings

3.An SVG canvas (800 × 500) where the user can draw with the mouse

4.Script reference linking the JavaScript file for functionality

5.This setup ensures there is a workspace (canvas) and a control option (clear button).

CSS (exp6.css)

1.The CSS styles the toolbar, button, and canvas for usability.

2.Toolbar: Small margin to separate controls from the canvas

3.Button: Styled with borders, padding, and background for a clickable look

4.Canvas: Bordered area with light background to make drawings visible

5.Paths (lines): No fill, black stroke, smooth rounded corners for natural drawing

JavaScript (exp6.js)

The JavaScript file is the core logic of this project. It controls how the drawing works and manages the clear functionality.

Element Selection:

1.Selects the SVG canvas where the user will draw.

2.Selects the Clear button to allow resetting the canvas.

3.Drawing State Management

4.A boolean variable drawing keeps track of whether the mouse is currently pressed (drawing mode on/off).

5.A variable currentPath stores the path element being drawn.

Capturing Mouse Position:

1.A helper function calculates the exact mouse position relative to the SVG canvas.

2.This ensures smooth and accurate drawing regardless of the canvas’s placement on the screen.

Mouse Events

Mouse Down (Start Drawing):

1.Sets drawing to true.

2.Creates a new SVG <path> element starting at the mouse position.

3.Adds this path to the canvas.

Mouse Move (Continue Drawing):

1.Runs only if drawing is true.

2.Updates the d attribute of the current path to add new line segments as the mouse moves.

3.This creates a continuous freehand line following the cursor.

Mouse Up (Stop Drawing):

1.Ends drawing by setting drawing back to false.

2.Resets currentPath so a new stroke can start next time.

Clear Button Functionality:

1.When the Clear button is clicked, it removes all child elements (paths) inside the SVG.

2.This instantly clears the canvas, giving the user a fresh workspace.

Key Points of JavaScript Functionality:

1.Real-time drawing achieved by continuously updating the path while the mouse moves.

2.State tracking using drawing and currentPath ensures lines only appear when the mouse is pressed.

3.Accurate mouse positioning ensures drawing happens inside the SVG area, not relative to the whole screen.

4.Dynamic path creation allows multiple strokes without overwriting old ones.

5.Clear button control instantly resets the canvas by removing all paths.

End Result: The user can freely draw on the SVG canvas with their mouse, creating smooth freehand lines. The Clear button resets the canvas so new drawings can be started anytime.
